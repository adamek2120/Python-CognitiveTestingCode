# Python-CognitiveTestingCode
My python code that was used to create the Flanker Task, N-back task, Feeling Scale, and Felt Arousal Scale for my dissertation study.

This is the script I developed during my Ph.D. in order to evaluate cognitive and affective performance for study participants pre and post intervention. Includes:

1. Flanker task (practice and test trials)
2. 2-back task (practice and test trials)
3. 3-back task (practice and test trials)
4. Feeling Scale and Felt arounsal scale before and after each task

Analysis of the results are done using Rscript
